# UdemyAPIClient
My attempt at a cool Udemy API app

This program will call the Udemy API once per hour and grab any new unanswered questions, and display them in the console.

You can then answer the question and it will post the answer under your user name to the student.

Replace UDEMY_TOKEN with the API token they give you at https://www.udemy.com/instructor/account/api

Replace INSTRUCTOR_NAME with the name of the instructor who generated the token. This will be used to skip over questions already answered.

Pull request if you can make improvements.
